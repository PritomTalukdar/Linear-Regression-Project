Linear Regression on Auto MPG Dataset

Project Overview

This project uses Linear Regression(both single variable and multi variable) to predict the miles per gallon (MPG) of automobiles based on features like horsepower, weight, displacement, etc.
It includes:

1. Data cleaning (handling missing values)

2. Data visualization (pairplots, heatmaps)

3. Model training and evaluation.

How to run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-auto-mpg.git

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn

Open Linear_Regression.ipynb and run all cells.
